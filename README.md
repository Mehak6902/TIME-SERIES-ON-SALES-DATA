# TIME-SERIES-ON-SALES-DATA

To define well-defined promo strategy, I once need to analysis data in terms of impacts of promos. In that case, since data is based on time series, I once referred to use time series decomposition. After I decomposed observed data into trend, seasonal, and residual components, We exposed the impact of promos clearly to make a decision which promo is better in each country.

In addition, I used Random Forest Regression in this forecasting problem to boost our decision.
